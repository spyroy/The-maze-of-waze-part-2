	 * Each fruit has to be on an edge, hence it can't be "floating" fruit
	 * The fruits can be neither apple or banana.
	 * If the robot goes from a lower key of node to a bigger key, and there is an apple, the robot will take the apple and the apple will change the position to a different edge randomly.
	 * If the robot goes from a bigger key of node to a lower key, and there is a banana, the robot will take the banana and the banana will change the position to a different edge randomly.
