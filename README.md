# maze of waze the game
### this is a game that builded on sources from Ex2 - https://github.com/spyroy/mtg2
### In this game there are two modes:
### The first is manual mode - in this mode you will have to collect as many fruits as possible, to do just click on the screen with the mouse. A message will appear and you will have to do provide a number of a node, and if a robot can reach there he will move to that node.
